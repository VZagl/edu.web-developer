			CHAPTER I. <br />
			Down the Rabbit-Hole
		</h2>

		<p>
			Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
			bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the
			book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in
			it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice “without pictures or
			conversations?”
		</p>
		<p>
			So she was considering in her own mind (<s>as well as she could</s>, for
			the hot day made her feel very <u>sleepy and stupid</u>), whether the
			pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up
			and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran
			close by her.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>There was nothing</strong> so <em>very</em>
			<mark>remarkable</mark> in that; nor did Alice think it so
			<em>very</em> much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh
			dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards, it
			occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time
			it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually
			<em>took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket</em>, and looked at it, and
			then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind
			that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or
			a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the
			field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a
			large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
